EmbodiChain
===========

.. image:: ../../assets/imgs/teaser.jpg

EmbodiChain is an end-to-end, GPU-accelerated framework for Embodied AI.
It streamlines research and development by unifying high-performance
simulation, automated generative data pipelines, modular model
architectures, and efficient training workflows. This integration
enables rapid experimentation, seamless deployment of intelligent
agents, and effective Sim2Real transfer for real-world robotic systems.

.. NOTE::
   EmbodiChain is in Alpha and under active development: * More
   features will be continually added in the coming months. You can find
   more details in the
   `roadmap <https://dexforce.github.io/EmbodiChain/main/resources/roadmap.html>`__.
   * Since this is an early release, we welcome feedback (bug reports,
   feature requests, etc.) via GitHub Issues.
