    The repository is gated. Either set the ``HF_TOKEN`` environment variable or
    run ``huggingface-cli login`` before calling this function.

    If your network requires an HTTP proxy, set ``HTTPS_PROXY`` or
    ``https_proxy`` in the environment before launching Python.

    Args:
        repo_id: HuggingFace repository ID.
        filename: Checkpoint path in the repo, e.g. ``franka/franka.pt``.
        token: HuggingFace API token. Falls back to the ``HF_TOKEN``
            environment variable or the cached token from
            ``huggingface-cli login``.
        endpoint: HuggingFace-compatible endpoint URL. Defaults to
            ``https://huggingface.co``. Mirrors that merely redirect to the
            real hub are not supported.

    Returns:
        str: Local path to the downloaded checkpoint file.
