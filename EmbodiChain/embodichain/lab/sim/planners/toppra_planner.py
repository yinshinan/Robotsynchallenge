       dies.  This is what guarantees no residual worker processes when the

       Because of this, callers never need to explicitly shut the planner
       down — workers self-terminate with the parent.

    2. **atexit clearing (fork only).**  When ``fork`` is used, the parent
       has usually already initialized CUDA/GPU by the time the pool is
       created, and ``fork`` copies the parent's atexit registry into the

       cleanup routines on exit, which can deadlock or corrupt state.  With
       ``spawn`` this is not necessary, but the initializer still runs so
