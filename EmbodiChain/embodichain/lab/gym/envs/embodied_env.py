class EmbodiedEnvCfg(EnvCfg):
    """Configuration for Embodied AI environments.

    `EmbodiedEnvCfg` extends `EnvCfg` with high-level scene, robot, sensor,
    object and manager declarations used to build modular embodied environments.
    The configuration is intended to be declarative: the environment and its
    managers (events, observations, rewards, dataset) are assembled from the
    provided config fields with minimal additional code.

    Typical usage: declare robots, sensors, lights, rigid objects/articulations,
    and manager configurations. Additional task-specific parameters can be
    supplied via the `extensions` dict and will be bound to the environment
    instance as attributes during initialization.

    Key fields
    - **robot**: `RobotCfg` (required) — the agent definition (URDF/MJCF, initial
        state, control mode, etc.).
    - **control_parts**: Optional[List[str]] — named robot parts to control. If
        `None`, all controllable joints are used.
    - **active_joint_ids**: List[int] — explicit joint indices to use for
        control (alternative to `control_parts`).
    - **sensor**: List[`SensorCfg`] — sensors attached to the robot or scene
        (cameras, depth, segmentation, force sensors, ...).
    - **light**: `EnvLightCfg` — lighting configuration (direct lights now,
        indirect/IBL planned for future releases).
    - **background**, **rigid_object**, **rigid_object_group**, **articulation**:
        scene object lists for static/kinematic props, dynamic objects, grouped
        object pools, and articulated mechanisms respectively.
    - **events**: Optional manager config — event functors for startup/reset/
        periodic randomization and scripted behaviors.
    - **observations**, **rewards**, **dataset**: Optional manager configs to
        compose observation transforms, reward functors, and dataset/recorder
        settings (auto-saving on episode completion).
    - **extensions**: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] — arbitrary task-specific key/value
        pairs (e.g. `success_threshold`, `control_frequency`) that are automatically
        set on the config *and* bound to the environment instance.
    - **filter_visual_rand** / **filter_dataset_saving**: booleans to disable
        visual randomization or dataset saving for debugging purposes.
    - **init_rollout_buffer**: bool — when true (or when a dataset manager is
        present and dataset saving is enabled) the environment will initialize a
        rollout buffer matching the observation/action spaces for episode
        recording.

    See `EmbodiedEnv` for usage patterns and the project documentation
    for full examples showing how to declare environments from these configs.
