class OnlineDataEngine:
    """Engine for managing Online Data Streaming (ODS) and environment rollouts.

    Creates a shared rollout buffer in CPU shared memory, spawns a dedicated
    simulation subprocess that fills the buffer with demonstration trajectories,
    and exposes a :meth:`sample_batch` method for the training process to draw
    batches of trajectory chunks.

    **Subprocess lifecycle**

    The simulation subprocess is started in :meth:`start` and immediately
    receives a fill signal so the buffer is populated before the first call to
    :meth:`sample_batch`.  The subprocess loops indefinitely: it waits for
    *fill_signal*, runs ``buffer_size // num_envs`` rollouts to overwrite every
    buffer slot, then goes back to waiting.

    **Concurrency and lock protection**

    :attr:`_lock_index` ``[write_start, write_end)`` is updated by the
    subprocess after each rollout so that :meth:`sample_batch` can skip the
    slot currently being written to, preventing partial reads.

    **Refill criterion**

    :meth:`sample_batch` accumulates the total number of individual trajectory
    samples drawn into :attr:`_sample_count`.  When this counter exceeds
    :attr:`~OnlineDataEngineCfg.refill_threshold` the fill signal is raised
    and the counter resets to zero.  This amortises the cost of GPU-accelerated
    simulation across many training iterations.

    **Initialisation barrier**

    The :attr:`is_init` property returns ``False`` until the subprocess
    completes the very first full buffer fill, after which it becomes
    permanently ``True``.  Training code should wait on this flag before
    calling :meth:`sample_batch` to avoid drawing all-zero data.
