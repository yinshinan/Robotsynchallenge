class OnlineDataset(IterableDataset):
    """Infinite IterableDataset backed by a live OnlineDataEngine shared buffer.

    Two sampling modes are supported depending on the ``batch_size`` argument:

    **Item mode** (``batch_size=None``, default)
        ``__iter__`` yields one ``TensorDict`` of shape ``[chunk_size]`` per step.
        Use with a standard ``DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=B)`` so the
        DataLoader handles collation and worker sharding.

    **Batch mode** (``batch_size=N``)
        ``__iter__`` yields one pre-batched ``TensorDict`` of shape
        ``[N, chunk_size]`` per step by calling
        ``engine.sample_batch(N, chunk_size)`` directly.
        Use with ``DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=None)`` to skip DataLoader
        collation and leverage the engine's bulk-sampling efficiency.

    **Dynamic chunk sizes**
        Pass a :class:`ChunkSizeSampler` as ``chunk_size`` to draw a fresh
        chunk length on every iteration step.  In batch mode the size is
        sampled once per step and applied uniformly to all trajectories in
        the batch, ensuring a consistent ``[batch_size, chunk_size]`` shape.
        Two built-in samplers are provided:

        - :class:`UniformChunkSampler` — uniform discrete distribution over
          ``[low, high]``.
        - :class:`GMMChunkSampler` — Gaussian Mixture Model, useful for
          multi-modal chunk-length curricula.

    .. note::
        ``__len__`` is intentionally absent — ``IterableDataset`` does not
        require it and the stream is infinite.

    .. note::
        Multi-worker DataLoader: each worker gets its own iterator; since
        sampling is independent random draws from shared memory, this is safe.

    Args:
        engine: A started OnlineDataEngine whose shared buffer is used for
            sampling.
        chunk_size: Fixed number of consecutive timesteps per chunk (``int``),
            or a :class:`ChunkSizeSampler` that returns a fresh size on every
            iteration step.
        batch_size: If ``None``, yield single chunks of shape ``[chunk_size]``
            (item mode). If an int, yield pre-batched TensorDicts of shape
            ``[batch_size, chunk_size]`` (batch mode).
        transform: Optional ``(TensorDict) -> TensorDict`` applied to each
            yielded item/batch before returning.

    Example — fixed chunk size, item mode::

        dataset = OnlineDataset(engine, chunk_size=64)
        loader  = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=32, num_workers=4,
                             collate_fn=OnlineDataset.collate_fn)
        for batch in loader:
            # batch has shape [32, 64, ...]
            train_step(batch)

    Example — fixed chunk size, batch mode::

        dataset = OnlineDataset(engine, chunk_size=64, batch_size=32)
        loader  = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=None,
                             collate_fn=OnlineDataset.passthrough_collate_fn)
        for batch in loader:
            # batch has shape [32, 64, ...]
            train_step(batch)

    Example — dynamic chunk size with uniform sampler::

        sampler = UniformChunkSampler(low=16, high=64)
        dataset = OnlineDataset(engine, chunk_size=sampler)
        loader  = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=32)
        for batch in loader:
            # chunk dimension varies each batch
            train_step(batch)

    Example — dynamic chunk size with GMM sampler::

        sampler = GMMChunkSampler(
            means=[16.0, 64.0], stds=[4.0, 8.0], weights=[0.6, 0.4],
            low=8, high=96,
        )
        dataset = OnlineDataset(engine, chunk_size=sampler, batch_size=32)
        loader  = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=None)
