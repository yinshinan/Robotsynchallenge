# Collect Data
We provide 1,000 pre-collected trajectories per task as part of the open-source release **RoboSynChallenge** Dataset. The datasets hosted on HuggingFace are available at [here](https://edem-ai.github.io/robosynchallenge.github.io/#/data).

However, we still strongly recommend users to perform data collection themselves.
```python
bash launch/run_task.sh {task_name} [random|clear] [3_0/2_1] [Other Extra Arguments]
# View supported tasks and extra arguments: bash launch/run_task.sh -h
# bash launch/run_task.sh click_bell clear 3_0
# Collect data for the click_bell task without domain randomization and the data is the LeRobot 3.0 format.
# bash launch/run_task.sh mixer_operating random 2_1
# Collect data for the mixer_operating task involving domain randomization and convert the data to the LeRobot 2.1 format.
```

After data collection is completed, the collected data will be stored under `lerobot_dataset/{task_name}/`. The dataset task names are: `click_bell`, `handle_basket`, `water_pouring`, `table_rearrangement`, `items_handover`, `drawer_open_place`, `mixer_operating`, `item_assembly`, `manipulate_pipette`, `sample_loading`, and `open_pan`. For local collection, use `bash launch/run_task.sh -h` to view the tasks currently supported by the collection script.

If you want to convert `lerobot 3.0` to the `lerobot 2.1` format manually, we have also provide ready-made conversion scripts:
```python
python scripts/convert_lerobot3.0_to_2.1.py --repo-id {repo_id} --root /path/to/datasets
```
## 🔧 Data Collection Hardware
For GPUs equivalent to the RTX 5060 Ti, limit each collection task to approximately 500 episodes. Setting a much larger batch size per task may cause unexpected program interruptions and compromise collection stability. High-end GPUs at the RTX 4090 tier are not affected by this issue, allowing you to adjust the batch size per task as needed.

If you need to collect large amounts of data using a device like the 5060Ti, please follow this recommended procedure:

① Collect raw data in the LeRobot 3.0 format first;

② Run the merge script to combine data from multiple separate collection batches;

③ Convert the merged full dataset to LeRobot 2.1 format if required for your use case.

## Collect simulation data with depth information

To collect simulation data with depth information, you need to add the following to the camera definition section in the "sensor" field of the gym_config.json file for the corresponding task:

"enable_depth": true,

For example：

```json
{
    
    "sensor": [
        {
            "sensor_type": "Camera",
            "uid": "cam_high",
            "width": 640,
            "height": 480,
            "enable_mask": false,
            "enable_depth": true, # Add this line
            "intrinsics": [606.315186, 606.100952, 320.549316, 245.877106],

}
```

If you want to train on multiple datasets together (e.g., multi-task, mixed training with simulated and real data), use the [lerobot-edit-dataset tool](https://huggingface.co/docs/lerobot/using_dataset_tools) or the helper script [`launch/collect_combined_dataset.sh`](https://github.com/EDEM-AI/RoboSynChallenge/blob/main/launch/collect_combined_dataset.sh).
